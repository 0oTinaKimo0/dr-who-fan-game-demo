Game demo for CSCI 319

Controls

The player could choose from a “Joycon” icon and a “keyboard” icon on the title screen. The default control is with a Joycon. There is also a “mute music” icon on the title screen if the player wants to turn off the music.

Nintendo Switch left Joycon and a mouse controls:
The direction your mouse is pointing at is your viewing direction. Use the Joycon stick to move around. Press L for manual blink; ZL for pause/resume; - for restart; screenshot button for quit.

Keyboard and a mouse controls:
The direction your mouse is pointing at is your viewing direction. Use WASD to move around. Press B for manual blink; P for pause/resume; R for restart; Q for quit.

Known Bugs

1. The dimensions of collide rectangles are a little bit off, so sometimes it says two objects are colliding even if they seem not.
2. Sometimes if you are going diagonally, the player could go off the screen. This bug is very rare.
3. Even if the title screen says press any button to start, if you press the restart button, the game will restart at the title screen instead of going into the actual game. Refrain from pressing "R" or "escape" when in keyboard mode, and "-" and "screenshot" when in joycon mode.
